# ETA-Android-app
###Problem         
Friends schedule short trips all of the time. People go to lunch, dinner, a night out on the town, to the movies, etc. The problem is, there is always that one person who is always late and makes everyone wait. Personally, I never want to be the first person there and have to wait 30 minutes for the last person to arrive.
###Solution        
ETA, an app for you and your friends that predicts when you should leave your current location to arrive at the same time as everyone else. Throughout the homework assignments of this course, we will be expanding upon this solution. For the second homework, you will creating some models, views, and controllers as a first step into Android application development.
